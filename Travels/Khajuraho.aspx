        Khajuraho was once the religious centre of the Chandela Rajput kings, a Hindu dynasty
        that ruled this area of central India from the 10th to the 12th centuries. Even
        at that time, Khajuraho was a remote location which helped reduce the danger of
        external attack. The Chandelas were great patrons of the arts and great builders.
        At Khajuraho, the Chandelas built 85 temples over a period of 100 years from 950
        to 1050. The temples belong to two different religions; Hinduism and Jainism. After
        the decline of the Chandelas in the 13th century, the temples became forgotten and
        for many centuries were covered by dense jungle. The temples were only rediscovered
        during the 20th century. Today, only 25 temples survive and are spread over an area
        of 8 square miles, Khajuraho is a small village with a population of a few thousand.</p>
