            width="238" />Geographically, the Himalayas consist of three ranges. The Sub-Himalayan
        range (Shivalik mountains in India) are the youngest ranges having an elevation
        of about 1200 metres. The ranges are made of erosion material from the rising Himalayas.
        Next are the Lower Himalayan Ranges that run parallel to the Sub-Himalayan ranges.
        They are at elevations between 2000 to 5000 metres. A number of hill stations in
        India likShimla, Nainital and Darjeeling are located in these ranges. The northernmost
        ranges, oldest of the three are called Higher Himalayas. They have an elevation
        of more than 6000 metres and some of the world's highest peaks are located there.
        This includes the three highest-Mount Everest, K2 and Kanchenjunga.
        <br />
        <br />
        Vegetation in the Himalayan ranges vary with climate and altitude. The Sub-Himalayan
        ranges mainly have deciduous forests. The vegetation shifts ttemperate forests,
        conifers and tundra in the Higher Himalayan ranges. The topmost regions have a permanent
        snow line and does not allow any growth of vegetation. Evergreen rainforests could
        be seen in the far eastern Himalayas.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Himalayas are among the youngest mountain ranges on the planet. The theory of
        plate tectonics reveal that the Himalayas were formed as a result of continental
        collision along the convergent boundary between the Indo-Australian Plate and Eurasian
        Plate.
