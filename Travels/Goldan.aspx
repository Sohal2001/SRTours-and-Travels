        <font face="Arial" size="2">Sri Harmandir Sahib, also known as Sri Darbar Sahib or Golden
            Temple, (on account of its scenic beauty and golden coating for English speaking
            world), is named after Hari(God) the temple of God. The Sikhs all over the world,
            daily wish to pay visit to Sri Amritsar and to pay obeisance at Sri Harmandir Sahib
            in their Ardas.<br />

        <font face="Arial" size="2">Guru Arjan Sahib, the Fifth Nanak, conceived the idea of
            creating a central place of worship for the Sikhs and he himself designed the architecture
            of Sri Harmandir Sahib. Earlier the planning to excavate the holy tank (Amritsar
            or Amrit Sarovar ) was chalked out by Guru Amardas Sahib, the Third Nanak, but it
            was executed by Guru Ramdas Sahib under the supervision of Baba Budha ji. The land
            for the site was acquired by the earlier Guru Sahibs on payment or free of cost
            from the Zamindars (landlords) of native villages. The plan to establish a town
            settlement was also made. Therefore, the construction work on the Sarovar(the tank)
            and the town started simultaneously in 1570. The work on both projects completed
            in 1577 A.D.
            <br />
            <br />
            Guru Arjan Sahib got its foundation laid by a muslim saint Hazrat Mian Mir ji of
            Lahore on 1st of Magh, 1645 Bikrmi Samvat(December,1588). The construction work
            was directly supervised by Guru Arjan Sahib himself and he was assisted by the prominent
            Sikh personalities like Baba Budha ji, Bhai Gurdas ji, Bhai Sahlo ji and many other
            devoted Sikhs.<br />
            <br />
            Unlike erecting the structure on the higher level(a tradition in Hindu Temple architecture),
            Guru Arjan Sahib got it built on the lower level and unlike Hindu Temples having
            only one gate for the entrance and exit, Guru Sahib got it open from four sides.
            Thus he created a symbol of new faith, Sikhism. Guru Sahib made it accessible to
            every person without any distinction of Caste, creed, sex and religion.
            <br />
            <br />
            The building work completed in 1601 A.D. on Bhadoon Sudi 1st, 1661 Bikrmi Samvat
            (August/September,1604). Guru Arjan Sahib installed newly created Guru Granth Sahib,
            in Sri Harmandir Sahib and appointed Baba Budha ji as its first Granthi i.e. the
            reader of Guru Granth Sahib. After this event it attained the status of ‘Ath Sath
            Tirath’. Now the Sikh Nation had their own Tirath, a pilgrimage center<br />
            <br />
            Sri Harmandir Sahib, is built on a 67ft. square platform in the centre of the Sarovar(tank).
            The temple itself is 40.5ft. square. It has a door each on the East, West, North
            and South. The Darshani Deori (an arch) stands at the shore end of the causeway.
            The door frame of the arch is about 10ft in height and 8ft 6inches in breath. The
            door panes are decorated with artistic style. It opens on to the causeway or bridge
            that leads to the main building of Sri Harmandir Sahib. It is 202 feet in length
            and 21 feet in width.<br />
            <br />
            The bridge is connected with the 13 feet wide ‘Pardakshna’ (circumambulatory path).
            It runs round the main shrine and it leads to the ‘Har ki Paure’ (steps of God).
            On the first floor of ‘Har ki Paure’, there is continuous reading of Guru Granth
            Sahib.<br />
            <br />
            The main structure of Sri Harmandir Sahib, functionally as well as technically is
            a three-storied one. The front, which faces the bridge, is decorated with repeated
            cusped arches and the roof of the first floor is at the height of the 26 feet and
            9 inches.<br />
            <br />
            At the top of the first floor 4 feet high parapet rises on all the sides which has
            also four ‘Mamtees’ on the four corners and exactly on the top of the central hall
            of the main sanctuary rises the third story. It is a small square room and have
            three gates. A regular recitation of Guru Granth Sahib is also held there.<br />
            <br />
            On the top of this room stands the low fluted ‘Gumbaz’(dome) having lotus petal
            motif in relief at the base inverted lotus at the top which supports the ‘Kalash’
            having a beautiful ‘Chhatri’ at the end.<br />
            <br />
            Its architecture represents a unique harmony between the Muslims and the Hindus
            way of construction work and this is considered the best architectural specimens
            of the world. It is often quoted that this architecture has created an independent
            Sikh school of architecture in the history of art in India. </font><font face="Arial">
