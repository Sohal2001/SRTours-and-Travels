        hotspots. The southern states consist of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and
        Karnataka. The medieval rulers of the period like Pallavas, Cholas, Chalukyas, Nayaks,
        Kakatiyas and Vijayanagar rulers were deeply religious and constructed numerous
        big and small temples in the region. The temples they built also carried the stamp
        of their unique form of architecture. Dotting the southern landscape to this day,
        they attract devotees in large numbers from all parts of the country and even abroad.
        <br />
        The southern Indian states also boast of a long coastline. Along this vast coastline
        running into thousands of kilometres are some of India's most picturesque beaches.
        This combination of great temples and scenic beaches makes India's south a favoured
        holiday destination of many tourists.
