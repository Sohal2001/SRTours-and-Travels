        <br />
    </strong></span>The Kalka-Shimla Railway built to connect, the summer capital of
    India in 1903 at an altitude of 2076 meters offers a panoramic feast to experience
    the grandeur of the picturesque Himalayas from the shivalik foot hills at Kalka
    to several important points such as Dharampur, Solan, Kandaghat, Taradevi, Barog,
    Salogra, Summerhill, Shimla and beyond up to the silvery snow line near the towering
    peaks.<br />
    <br />
    The 96.54 kilometer line, built on a 2 feet six inches gauge, was opened for traffic
    November 9, 1903.Because of the high capital and maintenance cost, coupled with
    peculiar working conditions, the Kalka - Shimla Railway was allowed to charge fares
    that were higher than the prevailing tariffs on other lines. However, even this
    was not good enough to sustain the company and the Government had to purchase it
    on January 1, 1906.<br />
    <br />
    Spectacular scenery along the whole route, and the marvels of it's construction,
    keeps the traveler on this line spell bound. On leaving Kalka, 656 meters above
    sea level, the railway enters the foothills and immediately commences it's climb.<br />
    <br />
    Kalka-Shimla-Railway runs through 102 tunnels, some of which have hoary tales to
    tell. For instance, the longest tunnel at Barog, named after the engineer in charge
    of construction, bears the blood of it's creator who apparently committed suicide
    after making a mistake in laying the alignment. This tunnel is 1143.61 meters long
    and remained the second longest tunnel on Indian Railways for a long time. It is
    a straight tunnel, passing through fissured sand stone.<br />
    <br />
    Another tunnel at Taradevi, cutting through a hill on the peak of which is a famous
    temple, tells of the local superstition of the day that the Goddess would never
    permit it's construction. When construction was half through, great excitement arose
    from reported sightings of a huge serpent in the tunnel that had emerged to stop
    the work. Anti climatically the reptile turned out be a long iron pipe running along
    the tunnel to convey fresh air.<br />
    <br />
    The section has 864 bridges, only one of which is a 60 feet plate girder span and
    a steel truss. The others are viaducts with multi-arched galleries like the ancient
    Roman aqueducts.<br />
    <br />
    Bridge No. 493, historically known as the "Arch Gallery", situated between Kandaghat
    and Kanoh stations, is an arch bridge in three stages, constructed with stone masonry
    that stands good even today. Bridge No. 226, between Sonwara and Dharampur is an
    arch gallery bridge having 5 tier galleries of multiple spans, constructed with
    stone masonry and bridging a deep valley surrounded by high peaks.<br />
    <br />
    The railway has a ruling gradient of 1 in 25 with 919 curves, the sharpest being
    48 degrees. Climbing from 656 meters, the line ends at 2076 meters at Shimla.<br />
    <br />
    Road links for other scenic spots in these hills also take off from the Kalka -
    Shimla Railway. First, there is Kasauli, a British day cantonment town, small, quiet
    but picturesque. Home to a Louis Pasteur Institute that manufactures the anti-rabies
    vaccine and a Central Research Institute that makes vaccines against typhoid and
    cholera and antidotes against snake bite, Kasauli can be approached by road from
    Dharampur Station.<br />
    <br />
    Another famous hill station in the area is Chail. Piqued by British snobbery, the
    Maharajah of Patiala built his summer capital here as a rival to Shimla. Accessible
    from Kandhaghat or Shimla, Chail is at a height of 2150 meters. The Maharaja's Palace,
    built in the 19th Century, together with the Cottages of his staff are today a beautiful
    holiday resort. Chail boasts of the highest cricket ground of the world, over looking
    the Sutlej Valley, with a spectacular view of snow capped Himalayan ranges.
